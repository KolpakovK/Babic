        text: 'Statamic is a flat file cms based on Laravel since version 3, that came out Spring 2020. Before it was based on Lumen. Statamic is used by "Der Spiegel" which speaks for it I guess. Like every Laravel product over the last few years, Statamic is fashion-driven. It presents itself with a unique late 80s neon outfit and hip, conversational language in the docs. If you start with laravel you endup with Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js - it''s all coming out of one think-tank.'
